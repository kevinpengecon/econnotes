## Welcome to EconNotes

I am Kevin Peng, currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Economics, University of California, Irvine. The inspiration for me to make this GitHub Pages is two-fold, one from my Macroeconomic Theory II professor Dr. William Branch, who used a similar approach during his lecture in the height of the coronavirus era. Equally motivational is ["Paul's Online Notes"](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu), created by Dr. Paul Dawkins from Lamar University, which includes many helpful notes and tutorials on common university-level math courses.

## What's in EconNotes

First and foremost, EconNotes is a work in progress that I will continually update to include new materials.
