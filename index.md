## Welcome to EconNotes

I am Kevin Peng, currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Economics, University of California, Irvine. The inspiration for me to make this GitHub Pages is two-fold, one from my Macroeconomic Theory II professor Dr. William Branch, who used a similar approach during his lecture in the height of the coronavirus era. Equally motivational is ["Paul's Online Notes"](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu), created by Dr. Paul Dawkins from Lamar University, which includes many helpful notes and tutorials on common university-level math courses.

## What's in EconNotes

First and foremost, EconNotes is a work in progress that I will continually update to include new materials ~~whenever I have free time~~. My long-run goal is for the site to contain the following three levels: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced. Regardless of the level, I will go into more details in each topic than a typical corresponding course. Each economics class generally spans from 10 to 18 weeks, depending on the educational system and academic calandar, and instructors usually face trade-offs (hint-hint) when designing the course structure and have to either relinquish a few topics or gloss over here and there. You should (eventually) find most of what you need for an economics course on this site, and much more, should you be interested in a certain topic.

### Basic Economics

Economics at a basic level is catered towards both students in high school and first-year undergraduate. We shall visit the building blocks of modern economics using the magic word "rationality". You will need a preliminary understanding of algebra and graphs to master the topics but nothing beyond that. Basic economics shall contain the following sections:

0. Mathematics for Basic Economics
1. How Markets Work
2. What Governments Do
3. What Firms Do
4. What Consumers Do
5. What Happens in the Workplace
6. How "Well" an Economy Is Doing
7. What "Really" Happens in the Long Run
8. How Money Works in the Long Run
9. What Happens When Economies Interact
10. What Happens in the Short Run

Section 0 is a review on the math skills that are essential to this level of economics. Sections 1 through 5 are generally in a Basic Economics I course, which deals with the core concepts in microeconomics. Sections 6 through 10 are generally is a Basic Economics II course, which introduces students to topics in macroeconomics.

## Sources and Reference

The topics will follow a flow that most textbooks in economics generally follow. While I do not specifically follow a certain textbook for any of the segments, I am certainly biased by the ones I used when I was studying the corresponding courses. You may find the following textbooks useful for additional reading:

- Basic level: 
- Intermediate level:
- Advanced level: 

## A ~~Very Tentative and Ever-Changing~~ Timeline of Events

Firstly, as a Ph.D. student, I do need to place a higher priority to my real-life academics, which includes being a TA and research. This makes estimates to how fast things here go very, very very-able (pun intended with high confidence). Secondly, as my current "bubble" swirls more around microeconomics, the corresponding portions in the basic and intermediate level will likely be included before their macroeconomic counterparts. (Well that and because modern macroeconomics is considered to be micro-based, and it would be helpful if I can link back to micro stuff if they're created beforehand.) This is also the reason why I do not plan on including the Advanced level of macroeconomic theory any time soon, as I
