## Welcome to EconNotes

I am Kevin Peng, currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Economics, University of California, Irvine. The inspiration for me to make this GitHub Pages is two-fold, one from my Macroeconomic Theory II professor Dr. William Branch, who used a similar approach during his lecture in the height of the coronavirus era. Equally motivational is ["Paul's Online Notes"](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu), created by Dr. Paul Dawkins from Lamar University, which includes many helpful notes and tutorials on common university-level math courses.

## What's in EconNotes

First and foremost, EconNotes is a work in progress that I will continually update to include new materials ~~whenever I have free time~~. My long-run goal is for the site to contain the following three levels: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced. Regardless of the level, I will go into more details in each topic than a typical corresponding course. Each economics class generally spans from 10 to 18 weeks, depending on the educational system and academic calandar, and instructors usually face trade-offs (hint-hint) when designing the course structure and have to either relinquish a few topics or gloss over here and there. You should (eventually) find most of what you need for an economics course on this site, and much more, should you be interested in a certain topic.

### Basic Economics

Economics at a basic level is catered towards both students in high school and first-year undergraduate. We shall visit the building blocks of modern economics using the magic word "rationality". You will need a preliminary understanding of algebra and graphs to master the topics but nothing beyond that. Basic economics shall contain the following sections:

0. Mathematics for Basic Economics
1. How Markets Work
2. What Governments Do
3. What Firms Do
4. What Consumers Do
5. What Happens in the Workplace
6. How "Well" an Economy Is Doing
7. What "Really" Happens in the Long Run
8. How Money Works in the Long Run
9. What Happens When Economies Interact
10. What Happens in the Short Run

Section 0 is a review on the math skills that are essential to this level of economics. Sections 1 through 5 are generally in a Basic Economics I course, which deals with the core concepts in microeconomics. Sections 6 through 10 are generally is a Basic Economics II course, which introduces students to topics in macroeconomics.

### Intermediate Economics

Economics at an intermediate level sees materials covered in the second year of an undergraduate economics major course, and is sometimes a required course for students in business administration. We will build on top of concepts learned at a basic level and use more analysis and rigor. Calculus becomes an important tool at this level and is generally a prerequisite to intermediate courses. Intermediate economics shall contain the following sections:

0. Mathematics for Intermediate Economics
1. Consumer Theory and Welfare
2. Producer Theory and Costs
3. General Equilibirum and Choice Under Uncertainty
4. Industrial Organization and Game Theory
5. Public Economics and Deviations from Perfect Information
6. Macroeconomics in th Short Run
7. Macroeconomics in the Medium Run
8. Macroeconomics in the Long Run
9. Expectations
10. The Open Economy

Section 0 is a review on the calculus and probability theory needed for this level of economics. It also contains an introduction to two important tools in economics: comparative statics and optimization. Sections 1 through 5 are topics covered in Intermediate Microeconomics. Sections 6 through 10 are introduced in Intermediate Macroeconomics. Due to time constrainsts, many instructors will need to pick-and-choose which topics to focus on, but generally, most will put emphasis on at least sections 1-4 and 6-8.

### Advanced Microeconomic Theory

Economics at an advanced level is suitable for the core courses of an economics graduate program. Math skills are very important here and includes (but certainly not limited to, depending on the program) vector calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and real analysis (a review shall be contained in section 0). Currently, only the microeonomic segment is planned, with the following sections:

0. Mathematics for Advanced Economics
1. Neoclassical Producer and Consumer Theory
2. Choice Under Uncertainty
3. General Equilibirum
4. Concepts of Game Theory
5. Adverse Selection
6. Moral Hazard
7. Classical Abstract Choice Theory
8. Mechanism Design and Auctions
9. General Mechanisms and Voting
10. Assignment and Matching

## How to Use the Materials Here

## Terms and Conditions

## Sources and Reference

The topics will follow a flow that most textbooks in economics generally follow. While I do not specifically follow a certain textbook for any of the segments, I am certainly biased by the ones I used when I was studying the corresponding courses. You may find the following textbooks useful for additional reading:

- Basic level: 
- Intermediate level:
- Advanced level: 

## A ~~Very Tentative and Ever-Changing~~ Timeline of Events

Firstly, as a Ph.D. student, I do need to place a higher priority to my real-life academics, which includes being a TA and research. This makes estimates to how fast things here go very, very very-able (pun intended with high confidence). Secondly, as my current "bubble" swirls more around microeconomics, the corresponding portions in the basic and intermediate level will likely be included before their macroeconomic counterparts. (Well that and because modern macroeconomics is considered to be micro-based, and it would be helpful if I can link back to micro stuff if they're created beforehand.) This is also the reason why I do not plan on including the advanced level of macroeconomic theory any time soon, as someone with more confidence in the topic should be in charge of that segment. Lastly, due to logistical reasons, most of Advanced Microeconomic Theory will be updated much later in the future.

|Segment|Estimated Update|
|---|---|
|Advanced 0|September 2022|
|Intermediate 0|December 2022|
|Intermediate 4-6|March 2022|
|Intermediate 1-3|June 2022|
